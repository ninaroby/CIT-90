//The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks,
//as with import statements.

//The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems.
//When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.
